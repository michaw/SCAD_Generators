# SCAD_Generators

Collection of (currently one) OpenSCAD customizers with my own advancements.

## Sprocket Generator (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4170542)
This is based on the [Sprocket Generator V2 - OpenSCAD](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3059422) by haand001 on Thingiverse

I have added numerous features and clarified the customization options. 

Features added include:
- Support for dual-diameter bore-holes (squared sides)
- Shortened teeth
- Projection output for use with cutters. 
- Grouping of and helpful descriptions for options

Fixes
- Fixed always having one hole added, even if the quantity was set to zero

## Battery Holder
I created this to allow securing of an arbitrary number of SLA/AGM batteries to a platform or plate. This is designed to prevent the batteries slipping around.

Features:
- Customizable plate thickness, divider thickness & height. 
- Option for rounded corners on the holder
- Option for curved edges on the battery to provide a snug fit
- Option for screw holes (2 holes, countersunk)
