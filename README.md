This is based on the [Sprocket Generator V2 - OpenSCAD](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3059422) by haand001 on Thingiverse

I have added numerous features and clarified the customization options. 

Features added include:
- Support for dual-diameter bore-holes (squared sides)
- Shortened teeth
- Projection output for use with cutters. 
- Grouping of and helpful descriptions for options

Fixes
- Fixed always having one hole added, even if the quantity was set to zero
